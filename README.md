# Twitter_scraper
A flask-based tool to scrape tweets from Twitter with a simple-to-use GUI. It can then export the results to a CSV file in your "Downloads" folder.

## Setup
Set up a Python environment with flask, pandas, and selenium packages installed, then run the app from that folder and env. I used Python version 3.7.6, but any should work. Also, browser needs to be HTML5 compatible, otherwise some of the js may not work correctly. This repo has the Chrome web driver with it, but you can easily switch to Edge or Firefox if neccessary.

### Search term
Any term or hashtag can be searched. Please be responsible for what you search for, Twitter is a nasty place :/

### Sleep Timer
The sleep timer may need to be increased if the internet connection or processor cannot keep up. I use "2" or "3" normally, but that may be too quick for some.

## Disclaimer:
Any use of this application for illegal practices, including but not limited to illegal or unethical scraping, is the sole responsibility of the person running the application. Please consult with Twitter documentation before using this application.
